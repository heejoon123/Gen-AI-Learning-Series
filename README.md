# Gen-AI-Learning-Series
2025 Deep Learning to Generative AI learning series from multiple courses within Coursera to practice and further my Data Science skillsets in the ever-growing field. The following are a series of courses from Coursera to help for my Data Science concept review/advancement. This repository will hold the code files from the labs, assignments, and projects. For the sake to follow the guidelines, the answers to the quizzes will not be provided.
